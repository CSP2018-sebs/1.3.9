1.3.9


So everyone knows how all of our code was deleted yesterday right?  Yea so I went through, found an older copy, and replaced all of the deleted code I could.  I do not know why it now shows up as a website, but when you go into the editor all is well.  It shows your code correctly spaced, even if it does not in the GitHub preview.  I hope that what I did here was useful, because it was all I could think of to do.  (I had to rewrite all of our teams code.)  oof.  (;;)  


from future import print_function

''' PrisonerDilemma.py allows hard-coding different strategies for the Iterative Prisoners Dilemma, the canonical game of game-theory. Each strategy plays 100 to 200 rounds against each other strategy. The results of all previous rounds within a 100-200 round stretch are known to both players.

play_tournament() executes the tournament and stores output in tournament.txt

Players should each code their strategies in their assigned section of code.

Aggregated results are stored in tournament.txt
